GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 2.2
===============================

This is the second update to the second major release of the GNUstep Objective-C
runtime (a.k.a.  libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support the features
of modern dialects of Objective-C for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C
programs.

Highlights of this release include:

- Numerous improvements to the Objective-C++ exception interoperation code.
  The runtime now dynamically detects whether the libcxxrt, libsupc++, or
  libc++abi variant of the Itanium C++ Exception ABI is being used.  This is
  the first version to support exception interoperability with libc++abi.
- Because we no longer need to identify the specific C++ runtime, we can link
  to it indirectly via the C++ standard library, which enables more C++ to be
  used in the Objective-C runtime.
- The minimum CMake version has been bumped to 3.16, which supports
  Objective-C.  This support is now used, simplifying the build.
- Support for GC mode is gone.  Apple dropped support for this a long time ago.
- Support for Windows on Arm has been added.
- `objc_setUncaughtExceptionHandler` is added, which avoids consuming code
  needing to access a library-owned global.
- The selector-table code has been rewritten in C++, improving performance of
  adding selectors.  This is unlikely to have a measurable impact on
  performance outside of contrived test cases, but the new code is more
  maintainable.
- Several bug fixes in the ARC code, especially in corner cases surrounding
  weak references.

You may obtain the code for this release from git and use the 2.2 branch:

https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2.git

Alternatively, a tarball is available from:

https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2/archive/v2.2.zip
https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2/archive/v2.2.tar.gz

The submodule is available from:

https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map/archive/d37a410.zip
https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map/archive/d37a410.tar.gz

This will extract as robin-map-d37a41003bfbc7e12e34601f93c18ca2ff6d7c07.
You must move the contents of that directory into third_party/robin_map in the
libobjc2 tree.


The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements a superset of Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs.
