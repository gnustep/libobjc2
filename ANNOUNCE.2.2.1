GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 2.2.1
=================================

This a bugfix release for the second update to the second major release of
the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.  libobjc2).  This runtime was designed
to support the features of modern dialects of Objective-C for use with GNUstep and
other Objective-C programs.

Highlights of this release include:

- Various improvements for building and using libobjc2 on MinGW.
- Improved support for the PowerPC architecture.
- A fix for the detection of the tls-robin-map dependency.

You may obtain the code for this release from git and use the 2.2.1 branch:

Alternatively, a tarball is available from:

https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2/archive/v2.2.1.zip
https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2/archive/v2.2.1.tar.gz

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements a superset of Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs.
